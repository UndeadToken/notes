GraphQL is a layer between a client and a datastore like a personal assistant.
With GraphQL, your API schema and your database schemas are decoupled.
GraphQL API is organized around three main building blocks: the schema, queries, and resolvers.

Queries:
The request you make to your GraphQL personal assistant is the query, and it looks something like this:

query { stuff }

query { post(id: "123foo"){ title # Argument

query getMyPost($id: String) {  post(id: $id){ # Dynamic Argument

# Install for js
yarn add @apollo/client

# Install for vue
yarn add vue-apollo graphql apollo-boost
