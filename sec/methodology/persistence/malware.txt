virus life cycle.
design, repluication, launch, detection, incorporation,elimination

Types:
boot sector - moves boot sector to another location on the hard drive which causes the virus code to be executed first.
ransomware - this locks you out of your system resources and normallu demands some type of online payment. Examples: SamSam, WannaCash, Locky, CryptoLocker
shell - this virus wraps itself around the code of an application, which allows it to run its own code before the applications code every time.
cluster - modifies discovery table entries, so that system and user processes are pointed to the virus code itself instead of the intended application
multipartie - this virus attempts to infect the boot sector and files at the same time (virus with multiple infection vectors)
macro - infects templates created by microsoft office (normally word and excel)
polymorphic code - mutates its code (polymorphic engine) so the signature constantly changes
encryption - uses encryption to evade antivirus detection (may viruses use this feature)
metamorphioc - this virus rewrites itself every time it infects a new file
stealth - attempts to evade AV by intercepting the antivirus request to the opeprating system. the virus alters the request to show it is uninfected and then sends the request back to the antivirus commonly called a tunneling virus.
cavity - overwrites portions(null content sections) of host files so it doesnt increase size of the files
sparse infector - this type of virus infects occasionally time based.
file extension - this virus changes file extensions and tales advantage of people that have file extension view turned off. e.g. readme.txt.vbs will show as readme.txt because file extensions are turned off.
worms - a self-replicating and self-propagating program that uses networking machanisms to spread itself. worms eat up resources. e.g. code red, sql slammer, nimda
trojans - appear to perform as a desired function but actually performs actions without users knowledge e.g. Dyre, zeus

covert channel:
used to transmit information i a way rthats illigitemet or supposedly impossible it violates security policy on a system.

overt channel:
used to send information or peprform actions in a legitimate way (i.e tcp/ip)
