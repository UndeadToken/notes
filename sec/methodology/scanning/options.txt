-v, --verbose
	print down hosts + extra information

-g, --source-port <port>
	some firewall administrators make a ruleset exception in order to keep DNS (port 53) or FTP-DATA (port 20) working.

-n, -R
	-n disables all dns-resolution, while the -R enables DNS queries for all hosts even down ones. The default is to limit DNS resolution to active hosts.

--dns-servers <server1>[, <server2>[, ...]]
	defaulting to resolv.conf Nmap will determine your your DNS servers(not honored on IPv6 or --system-dns scans). Generally faster and more 'stealthy'.

--data-length <length>
	This option adds <length> of random bytes of data to every packet. Works with TCP, UDP and ICMP. Some IDS(Intrusion Detection Systems) including Snort have alerts for zero-byte ping packets. An option of 32 simulates Windows while 56 simulates linux Ping.

--ttl
	Prevent a scan from propagating beyond a local network.

Canned timing options: -T3, -T4, -T5
	Higher -T values speed up ping scanning as they do other features.

--max-parallelism, --min-parallelism <value>
	These affect how many probes may be outstanding at once. With he default ping type (two probes)
	
--min-rtt-timeout, --max-rtt-timeout, --initial-rtt-timeout <time>
	these options control how long nmap waits for a ping response

Input options: -iL <filename>, -iR <number>
	combine -iL -PN(disable ping) to avoid scanning hosts known to be up.

Output options:
	-oA, -oN, -oG, -oX
	
--randomize-hosts
	Shuffling the scan host order may make the scan more conspicuous, though it can make the output harder to read.

--reason
	Output discovery tests targets responded to.

--packet-trace
	More info than --reason including sequence numbers, TCP flags and TTL.

-D <decoy1, decoy2>
	Camouflaging the true attacker.

-6 The TCP connect-based ping scans (-PS)

-S <source ip address>, -e <sending device name>
