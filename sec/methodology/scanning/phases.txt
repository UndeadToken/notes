Target Enumeration
Nmap researches the host specifiers provided by the user which are resolved to ipv4, ipv6 addresses for scanning.
-sL -n (no reverse-DNS resolution)

Host Discovery (Ping Scanning)
-PN (no ping, treat all hosts as alive)
-sP -n (quit after host discovery)

Reverse DNS resolution
Once Nmap has determined which hosts to scan, it looks up the  reverse-DNS names of all hosts found online by the ping scan.
-n (skip, no resolution)
-R (resolve all)

Port scanning
Probes are sent and the responses (or non-responses) to those probes are used to classify remote ports into states such as open, closed, filtered.
-sP (ping scan)

Version detection
Nmap matches probe responses to a database of thousands of known service signatures to identify services running on ports.
-sV (enable version detection)

OS detection
Nmap detects an OS by matching probe repsonses to a database of signatures.
-O (enable OS detection)

Traceroute
Attempt to find network routes to hosts.
--traceroute (enable trace routing)

Script scanning
Nmap scripting engine (NSE) scripts allow for gaining for information about a system. Powered by Lua. Features include advanced version detection, notification of service vulnerabilities and discovery of backdoors and other malware.
--script {name}
-sC {name e.g. vuln}

Output
Collects information and outputs to the screen or file. Default is interactive format, also included is XML.
