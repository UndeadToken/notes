Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability allows an attacker to make a
server perform unintended network requests.

Return a HTTP response with a status code 301, 301, 303, 307 to point to an
internal IP address.

When you can't access the response you've found a blind ssrf.

# out-of-band (OOB) exfiltration
