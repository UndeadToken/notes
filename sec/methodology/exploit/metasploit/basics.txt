Exploit
An exploit is the means by which an attacker takes advantage of a flaw within a system.

Payload
A payload is code that is intended to be executed on an exploited system.

Shellcode
Shellcode is a set of instructions used as a payload when execution occurs. Typically written in assembly.

Module
A piece of software that can be used by the Metasploit Framework.
exploit modules are used to perform an attack.
auxiliary modules may be required to perform an action such as scanning or system enumeration.

Listener
Waits for an incomming connection of some sort from the an machine.

Interfaces:
- msfconsole
- msfcli (msfcli windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi RHOST=192.1698.1.155 PAYLOAD=windows/shell/bind_tcp E)
- armitage (gui)
- msfpayload (generate shellcode)
- msfencode (remove bad characters, evade IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems))

NASM Shell
nasm_shell.rb utility can be helpful when you're trying to make sense of assembly code, especially if, during exploit development, you need to identify the opcodes (the assembly instructions) for a given assembly command.
