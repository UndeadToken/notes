Windows
SAM File - windows hash password (C:\Windows\System32\Config\) locked when the OS boots up and encrypted.
Mount the windows partition mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1 (use fdisk -l to identify the drive to mount)
You may need to create the mount directory mkdir /mnt/sda1
cd /mnt/sda1/Windows/system32/config
Use samdump2 to decrypt the SAM file, the SAM file uses the system file, located within the same directory as SAM. BKhive can be used to help if theres a sys key bootkey from the system hive. bkhive system sys_key.txt, samdump2 SAM sys_key.txt > tmp/hashes.txt
samdump2 system SAM > /tmp/hashes.txt
use jtR to crack the hashes. http://www.openwall.com/john
Microsoft used a hashing algorithm called Lan Manager (LM), which suffered from several key weaknesses which amde the password cracking a trivial task, they converted the ltters to uppercase which drastically reduces the number of permutations. Also its a padded cipher, so < 14 chars are padded with null values. Then the password is split into 2 7 letter passwords which can be cracked individually.
Now microsoft uses NTLM,
john hashes.txt, john hashes.txt --format=nt

alternatively change the passwords with chntpw
chntpw -i /mnt/sda1/WINDOWS/system32/config/SAM (-i runs theprogram interactively)

Linux
Linux encrypted passwords are stored in /etc/shadow and users, groups etc are registered in /etc/passwd.
unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/linux_hashes.txt
john linux_hashes.txt


Security accounts manager:
- Stores password hashes
- SYS KEY

Types of password attacks:
- dictionary
- brute-force
- rule-based
- rainbow tables - precomputed tables

Rules:
"7 characters long & must contain 1 number"

Salting passwords:
- Random data input in the hash
- Randomly generated for each.

Types of rootkits:
Horse Pill - infects linux during boot process
Gray fish - equation group

Steganography tools:
QuickStego: BMP, JPEG,GIF
OpenStego: BMP,PNG
MP3Stego: MP3
StegoShare: BMP,JPEG,PNG,GIF,TIFF

Covering BASH tracks:
Bourne Again Shell
Disable history: export HISTSIZE=0
HISTSIZE: Determines how many commands are stored
clear history: history -c

TFTP - Trivial File Transfer Protocol (typically port 69):
Allow a client to get a file from or put a file onto a remote host.
Cannot do user auth or list diretcories.

RFC 1350 helps define how the TFTP protocol works:
959 FTP
793 TCP
1321 MD5 HASH

Backdoor trojans:
- collection information
- terminate tasks and processes
- run tasks and processes
- download additional files
- upload files/content
- open command-line shells
- perform denial of service against other computers from the infected machine
- change the computer settings
- restart or shutdown the computer

RAT backdoors:
Gh0st
Mirai botnet: IoT

PwnWind
