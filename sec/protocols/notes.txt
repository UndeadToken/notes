Tracing routes:

The OS uses routing tables to figure out which gateway to send traffic to.

- Windows
  tracert <domain> -h <maxhops>
  route print

- Linux
  traceroute <domain> -m <maxhops>
  netstat -r

Notes:

- A TCP header contains a source and destination port number.
- A TCP payload and header are commonly called a segment
- A UDP payload and header are commonly called a datagram
- An IP payload and header are commonly called a packet
- A list of assigned port numbers /etc/services
- IPv4 uses 32 bit addresses
- IPv6 uses 128-bit addresses
- long strings of 0000 can be collapsed into :: e.g. fe80:0000:897b:581e:44b0:2057 -> fe80::897b:581e:44b0:2057
- IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmatic (IEEE 754)
- Big endian stores the most significant byte at the lowest address
- Little endian stores the least significant byte at the lowest address
- The endiannes of a value is commonly called network order or host order
- Ethernet defines the maximum size of traffic frames to 1500 octets where as IP on top of that can have up to 65536 bytes.
- Fragmentation allows the network stack to convert large packets into smaller fragments when the application or OS knows the entire packet cannot be handled by the next layer
