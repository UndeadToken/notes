A network protocol serves many functions, including one or more of the
following:

- Maintaining session state
  Protocols typically implement mechanisms to create new connections
  and termination existing connections.

- Identifying nodes through addressing
  Data must be transmitted to the correct node on a network. Some
  protocols implement an addressing mechanism to identify specific
  nodes or groups of nodes.

- Controlling flow
  The amount of data transferred across a network is limited. protocols
  can implement ways of managing data flow to increase throughput and
  reduce latency.

- Guaranteeing the order of transmitted data
  Many networks do not guarantee that the order in which data is sent
  will match the order in which it's received. A protocol can reorder
  the data to ensure it's delivered in the correct order.

- Detecting and correcting errors
  Many networks are not 100% reliable; data can become corrupted. It's
  important to detect corruption and, ideally, correct it.

- Formatting and encoding data
  Data isn't always in a format suitable for transmitting data on a
  network. A protocol can specify ways of encoding data, such as
  encoding English text into binary values.
