IPS describes how network communication works; however, for analysis purposes,
most of the IPS model is not relevant. It's simpler to use another conceputal
model.

- Content layer
  Provides the meaning of what's being communicated. e.g. file request.

- Encoding layer
  Provides rules to govern how you represent your content. e.g. HTTP GET

- Transport layer
  Provides rules to govern how data is transferred between the nodes. e.g.
  TCP/IP connection to port 80.
