### Electroencephalography (EEG)

When neurons ara activated and syncronized they produce electical pulses. The rythm of these pulses formed oscillations called brain waves. When many neurons inetract in this way at the same time the activity can be detected outside of the brain.

By placing electrodes on the scalp the brain activity can be measured, amplified and visualised.

Brain waves are generally measured in their amplitude or depth and their frequency which descirbes the number of oscillations in a given period of time.
There are five main brainwave patterns. Different brainwaves are connectd with different brain states.

γ Gamma  (hightened perception, insight and intuition, 26-100HZ)
β Beta   (alert, focused, 13-32HZ)
α Alpha  (calm, relaxed, 8-13HZ)
θ Theta  (day dreaming, 4-8HZ)
δ Delta  (deep dreamless sleep, 0.5-4HZ)

ε Epsilon (Basically dead, but not dead. 0.25 per 10 seconds - 0.5 cycles per second)
λ Lambda  (transidental state, out of body experience, 200HZ)

Gamma waves occur after alpha waves present in the right visual cortex, which controls sight, are calmed freeing reosurces

Calming the neurons in the right visual cortex to reduce the amount of visual data being taken in to free up resources for the more important cognition task. That's why often people close their eyes or look away when thinking.

Alpha waves are commonly associated with seritonine, present during artistic creativity, deep meditation or auto-pilot e.g. brushing teeth. Positively associated with memory, creativity and psychological wellbeing.

The brain spends time in the "delta" state when repairing.

"Yogic state" of suspendid animation.
