How to trade – different types of orders

Traders can place various types of buy or sell orders. Some orders guarantee immediate execution, while others may state a price threshold or other conditions that trigger execution. Orders are typically valid for the same trading day unless specified otherwise.
A market order is intended for immediate execution of the order upon arrival at the trading venue, at the price that prevails at that moment. In contrast, a limit order only executes if the market price is higher than the limit for a sell limit order, or lower than the limit for a buy limit order. A stop order, in turn, only becomes active when the market price rises above a specified price for a buy stop order, or falls below a specified price for a sell order. A buy stop order can be used to limit the losses of short sales. Stop orders may also have limits.

Numerous other conditions can be attached to orders. For example, all or none orders prevent partial execution; they are filled only if a specified number of shares is available and can be valid for a day or longer. They require special handling and are not visible
to market participants. Fill or kill orders also prevent partial execution but cancel if not executed immediately. Immediate or cancel orders immediately buy or sell the number of shares that are available and cancel the remainder. Not-held orders allow the broker to decide on the time and price of execution. Finally, the market on open/close orders executes on or near the opening or closing of the market. Partial executions are allowed.
