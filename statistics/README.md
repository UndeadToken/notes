### Definitions:

- Statistics is the study of how to collect, organize, analyze, and interpret numerical information and data.

- Statistics is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data.

- Statistics is used to help us make decisions. This is espectially important in health care and publish health.

### Individuals & Variables

#### Outside of Statistics

- Individuals are people. 
- A variable is a factor that can vary, possibly causing a problem.

#### Meaning in Statistics

- Individuals are people or objects in a study
- A variable is a characteristic of the individual to be measured or observed.

### Examples

Individuals may be geographical locations, other times they ay be institutions such as hospitals and clinics or programs.

- Statistics is used in healthcare and othe diciplines to help aid the decision making.

- Understanding statistics is necessary to understand processes in healthcare.

|Individual|Variable|
|----------|--------|
|Kidney dialysis patient|Number of blood transfusions|
|Baby born to a mother who smokes cigarettes|Birthweight|
|Post-menopausal woman|Compliance with health screening recommendations|
|State with casinos|Rate of pathological gambling|
|County with hospitals|Medication error rate|
|Urban city|Rate of overdose deaths|

### Population parameter & Sample Statistic

#### Population

- A population is a group of people or objects with a common theme. When every member of that group is considered, it is a population.

e.g. Theme: Nurses who work at X general hospital. Population: List from Human Resources of every currenyly employed nurse at X hospital.

#### Sample

- A sample is a small portion of the population.
- It can be a representative sample.
- But it can also be a biased sample.

e.g. Only survey ICU nurses at X hospital (Not a representative sample). At least one nurse from each department (More representative sample).

#### Population vs. Sample Data

Population Data:

- In population data, data from every individual in the population is available.

- Entire population = census

Sample Data:

- In sample data, data is only available from some of the individuals in the population.

- Very commonly used in research studies of patients.

### A Parameter vs. Statistics
 
- A parameter is a measure that describes the entire population.

- A statistic is a measure that describes only a sample of a population.

#### Examples of Parameters & Statistics

|Parameter|Statistic|
|---------|---------|
|Mean age of every American on Medicare|Mean age of Americans on Medicare estimated using MBS|
|The porportion of Americans addicted to cigarettes|The proportion of Americans who admit they are addicted to cigarettes|
|Actual voter turnout|The proportion of people in opinion polls who say they plan to vote|
 
#### Describing vs. Inferring

In statistics, it is important to properly indentify measures as population parameters or sample statistics. Different types of data are used for parameters and statistics.

- Descriptive statistics involve methods of organizing, picturing, and summarizing information from samples and populations.

- Inferential statistics involves methods of using information from  sample to draw conclusions regarding the population.

### Classifying Variables

Quantitative (continuous) is a numerical measurement of something, time of admit; year of diagnosis, sysolic blood pressure, platelet count. Qualitative (Categorical) refers to a quality or categorical characteristic of something (type of insurance, country of origin, stage of cancer, trauma center level).

- Quantitative vs. qualitative data (internal vs ratio, nominal vs ordinal)

#### Quantitative

Differences between data values are meaningful.

- Interval - A space between 2 things. (there is no true zero)
- Ratio - (there is a true zero)

#### Qualitative

- Nominal (applies to categories, labels or names, and cannot be ordered from smallest to largest)

- Ordinal (applies to data that can be arranged in order in categories, but the difference between data values cannot be determined, or is meaningless.)
