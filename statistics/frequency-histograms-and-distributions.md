# Frequency Histograms & Distributions

A specific type of bar chart made from data in a frequency table. Frequency histograms and relative frequency histograms. The purpose of the chart is to identify the "distribution" of the data.

### Example Frequency Table

|Class Limits|Frequency|Relative Frequency|Cumulative Frequency|
|------------|---------|------------------|--------------------|
|1-8 miles   |14       | 0.23             |14                  |
|9-16 miles  |21       | 0.35             |14+21=35            |
|17-24 miles |11       | 0.18             |35+11=46            |
|25-32 miles |6        | 0.10             |46+6=52             |
|33-40 miles |4        | 0.07             |52+4=56             |
|41-48 miles |4        | 1.07             |56+4=60             |
|Total       |60       | 1.00             |60                  |

### Main types of Distibutions

- Normal distribution (also called mound-shaped symmetrical)
- Uniform distribution
- Skewed left distribution
- Skewed right distribution
- Bimodal distribution

### Outliers

Outliers are data values that are "very different" from other measurements in the dataset.

### Cumulative Frequency

In "Cumulative Frequency" you add up all the classes efore the class you are on. The first class is alawys the same as the frequency. Each cumulative frequency is equal to or higher than the last one.

### Chart of Cumulative Frequency: Ogive

Classes along the x-axis and cumulative frequency along the y-axis because cumulative frequency goes from class to class, the ogive line always goes up to the top frequency.
