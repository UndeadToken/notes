# Randomization

Randomization is used to assign indiviudusals to treatment groups. This helps bias in selecting members for eah group. It creates "lurking variables" evenly.

- Recruit sample
- Measure confounders (e.g. smoking), outcome
- Random assignment
	- Group treatment A
	- Group treatment B (Placebo or old treatment)
- Measure confounders outcome

- Steps in a complely randomized experiment
- Placebo and placebo effect
- Blocked rendomization
- Blocking

### Placebo & Placebo Effect

- Placebo effect occurs when there is no treatment, but participant assumes s/he is receiving treatment and responds favorably.

- The placebo is given to a control group, which receives the placebo (or attention control if treatment is not a drug)
- used as a control or comparison group

### Blocked randomization

Solves unbalanced due to aparticular lurking variable i.e Gender.

- If you want men and women equal in two randomized groups, create "blocks" with two slots - one for a man, and one for a woman.

- As people come in and enroll in the study and you measure them, assign them to blocks.

- Then, reandomize the blocks. You will get a paired couples in each group.

  Block 1       Block2
[man|woman]   [man|woman]

### Blinding

- Blinding is where a person (participant, research staff) is deliverately not told of a treatment assignment in a study so s/he is not biased in reporting study information.
	- Example: A participant is blinded to treatment or placebo
	- Example: A study readilogist may be blinded to treatment when looking at images during study procedures

- Double-blind means study staff and participant do not know treatment assignment
