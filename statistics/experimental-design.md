# Experimental Design

### Basic Guidelines for Planning a Statistical Study

- State a hypothesis
- Identify the individuals of interest
- Specify the variables to measure
- Determine if you will use the entire population or a sample
  - If you choose a sample, choose a sampling method
- Address ethical concerns before data collection
- Collect the data
- Use descriptive or inferential statistics to answer your hypothesis
  - Make recommendations for future studies

### Experiment vs. Observational Study

#### Experiment

- A treatment or intervention is deliverately assigned to the individuals

- The purpose is to study the possible effect of the treatment or intervention on the variables measured

#### Observational Study

- Observations and measurements of individuals are taken

- However, no treatment or intervention is assigned by  researcher

### Replication

- Studies must be done rigorously enough to be replicated

- Replicating the results of observational studies and experiments is necessary for science to progress

### Avoiding Bias in Survey Design

Surveys can provide a lot of useful information however, it is important that all aspects of survey design and administration minimize "bias". Several consideratins should be made.

### Truthfulness of Response

- Respondents may lie on purpose
	- If asked a question that is too personal
	- If asked a question too hard to think about
- Respondents may lie inadvertently
	- May not remember if asking about something that happened a long time ago
	- May have "recall bias" influenced by events that have happened since original event

### Hidden Bias

- Question wording may induce a certain response
- order of questions and otherwording may induce a certain response
- Scales of questions may not accurately measure responses

### Interviewer Influence

- This is iportant with in-person and phone surveys
- best to have interviewer from same population as research participent
- All verbal and non-verbal influences matter

### Lurking Variable

- "Lurk" means to sneak around behind the scenes
- A "lurking variable" is a variable that is associated with a condition, but may not cause that condition
- For example, we know that having more education increases income. However, people of the same education level do not make the same income.
- Lurking variables are sex and race. In the US, according to the Department of Labor, these variables can decrease a persons income at the same level of education.


### Example

- Hypothesis: Air pollution causes asthma in children who live in urban settings.

- Individuals: Children in urban settings.

- Variables: Air pollution and asthma
