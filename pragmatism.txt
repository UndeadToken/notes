Software Entropy:
While software development is immune from almost all physical laws, entropy
hits us hard. Entropy is a term from physics that refers to the amount of
"disorder" in a system. Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that
the entropy in the universe tends toward a maximum. When disorder increases in
software, programmers call it "software rot".

The most common cause of software rot is work place psychology.

Don't live with broken windows. The broken window theory suggests 'don't leave
"broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired'. Fix
each one as soon as it's discovered, or "board it up" and prevent further damage.

Neglect accelerates rot faster than any other factor.

Your knowledge portfolio
You're knowledge and experience are expiring assets.
- Serious investors invest regularly - as a habit
- Diversification is key to long term success
- Smart investors balance their portfolios between conservative and high-risk, high reward investments
- investors try to buy low and sell high for maximum return
- portfolios should be reviewed and rebalanced periodically

WISDOM:
- What do you want them to learn?
- what is their Interest in what you've got to say?
- how sophisticated are they?
- how much detail do they want?
- Whom do you want to own the information?
- How can you motivate them to listen to you?

DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative
representation within a system.
- Imposed duplication - developers feel they have no choice - the environment seems to require duplication
- Inadvertant duplication - developers don't realize that they are duplicating information
- Impatient duplication - developers get lazy and duplicate because it seems easier
- Interdveloper duplication - multiple people on a team (or on different teams), duplicate a piece of information

Meyer's Uniform Access Principle
All services offered by a module should be available through a uniform notation,
which does not betray whether they are implemented through storage or through
computation.

Shortcuts make for long delays
