Advanced Identity

STS - Security Token Service

- Allows to grant limited and temporary access to AWS resources (up to 1 hour)
- AssumeRole: Assume roles within your account or cross account
- AssumeRoleWithSAML: return credentials for users logged with SAML
- AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
    - Return creds for users logged with an IdP (Facebook Login, Google Login, OIDC compatible...)
    - AWS recommends against using this, and using Cognito Identity Pools instead
- GetSessionToken: for MFA, from a user or AWS account root user
- GetFederationToken: obtain temporary crds for a federated user
- GetCallerIdentity: return details about the IAM user or role used in the API call
- DecodeAuthorizationMessage: decode error message when an AWS API is denied

Using STS to Assume a Role

- Define an IAM Role within your account or cross-account
- Define which principals can access this IAM Role
- Use AWS STS (Security Token Service) to retrieve credentials and impersonate the IAM Role you have access to (AssumeRole API)
- Temporary credentials can be valid between 15 minutes to 1 hour

STS with MFA

- Use GetSessionToken from STS
- Appropriate IAM policy using IAM Conditions
- aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent:true
- Reminder; GetSessionToken returns:
    - Access ID
    - Ecret Key
    - Session Token
    - Expiration Date

Advanced IAM

Authorisation Model Evaluation of Policies, simplified

1.) If there's an exploit DENY, end decision and DENY
2.) If there's an ALLOW, end decision with ALLOW
3.) Else Deny

Decision starts at DENY -> Evaluate all applicable Policies -> Explicit Deny? -> Deny, allow -> Allow? Allow

IAM Policies & S3 Bucket Policies

- IAM Policies are attached to users, roles, groups
- S3 Bucket Policies are attached to buckets
- When evaluating if an IAM Principal can perform an operation X on a bucket, the union of its assigned IAM Policies will be evaluated
- IAM Policy + S3 Bucket Policy = Total Policy Evaluated

E.g.

- IAM Role attached to EC2 authorises RW to "my bucket"
- No S3 bucket policy attached
- EC2 instance can read and write to "my bucket" ?

- IAM Role attached to EC2 instance, authorises RW to "my bucket"
- S3 Bucket Policy attached, explicit deny to the IAM Role
- => EC2 instance cannot read and write to "my bucket"

- IAM Role attached to EC2 instance, no S3 bucket permissions
- S3 Bucket Policy attached, explicitly RW allow to the IAM Role
- => EC2 instance can read and write to "my bucket"

- IAM Role attached to EC2 instance, explicit deny S3 bucket permissions
- S3 Bucket Policy attached, explicit RW allow to the IAM Role
- => EC2 instance cannot read and write to "my bucket"

Dynamic Policies with IAM

- How do you assign each user a /home/<user> folder in an S3 bucket?
- Option 1:
    - Create an IAM policy allow georgics to have access to /home/georgios
    - Create an IAM policy allow Sarah to have access to /home/Sarah
    - Create an IAM policy allow matt to have access to /home/matt
    - ... One policy per user!
    - This doesn't scale
- Option 2:
    - Create one dynamic policy with IAM
    - Leverage the special policy variable ${aws:username}

{ 	"Sid": "AllowAllS3ActionsInUserFolder",
	"Action": ["s3:*"],
	"Effect": "Allow",
	"Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-company/home/${aws:username}/*"] }

Inline vs Managed Policies

- AWS Managed Policy
    - Maintained by AWS
    - Good for power users and administrators
    - Updated in case of new services / new APIs
- Customer Managed Policy
    - Best practice, re-usable, can be applied to many principals
    - Version Controlled + rollback, central change management
- Inline
    - Strict one-to-one relationship between policy and principal
    - Policy is deleted if you delete the IAM principal

Granting a User Permissions to Pass a Role to an AWS Service

- To configure many AWS services, you must pass an IAM role to the service (this happens only once during setup)
- The service will layer assume the role and perform actions
- Example of passing a role:
    - To an EC2 instance
    - To a Lambda function
    - To an ECS task
    - To CodePipeline to allow it to invoke other services
- For this, you need the IAm permission iam:PassRole
- It often comes with iam:GetRole to view the role being passed

Can any role be passed to any service? No
Roles can only be passed to what their trust allows.
A trust policy for the role that allows the service to assume the role.

Directory Services

What is Microsoft Active Directory (AD)?

- Found on any Windows Server with AD Domain Services
- Database of objects: User Accounts, Computers, Printers, File Shares, Security Groups
- Centralised security management, create account, assign permissions
- Objects are organised in trees
- A group of trees is a forest

- AWS Managed Microsoft AD
    - Create your own AD in AWS, manage users locally, supports MFA
    - Establish "trust" connections with your on-premise AD
- AD Connector
    - Directory Gateway (proxy) to redirect to on-premise AD, supports MFA
    - Users are managed on the on-premise AD
- Simple AD
    - AD-compatible managed directory on AWS
    - Cannot be joined with on-premise AD

Auth -> On-prem AD -> trust -> AWS Managed AD -> Auth

On Prem AD -> Proxy -> AD Connector -> Auth
