# Amazon S3 – Infinity Scaling Storage

## Overview
- Object storage for unlimited data.
- Use cases: backup, archiving, disaster recovery, big data analytics, static website hosting, software delivery, media hosting, hybrid cloud storage.
- Highly durable: 11 9’s (99.999999999%) across multiple Availability Zones.
- Buckets exist in a specific AWS Region.

---

## Buckets
- Must have globally unique names.
- Naming rules:
  - 3–63 characters, lowercase, no underscores.
  - Cannot resemble an IP or start with `xn--` or end with `-s3alias`.
- Buckets “contain” objects but there are no true directories (slashes in keys mimic folders).

---

## Objects
- Composed of **Key + Value**.
  - Key = full path (`s3://mybucket/folder/file.txt`).
  - Value = file content (max 5 TB).
- Supports metadata, tags, and versioning.
- Multi-part upload required for objects >5GB.

---

## Security
- **User-based:** IAM policies.
- **Resource-based:** Bucket policies, ACLs, Access Points.
- **Encryption:**
  - SSE-S3: AWS-managed keys (AES-256).
  - SSE-KMS: AWS KMS-managed keys.
  - SSE-C: Customer-provided keys.
  - Client-side encryption: handled by client.
- Encryption in transit: HTTPS (mandatory for SSE-C).

---

## Versioning
- Enabled at bucket level.
- Protects against accidental deletes and allows rollback.
- MFA Delete: requires multi-factor authentication for object deletion.

---

## Replication
- **CRR (Cross-Region)** & **SRR (Same-Region)**.
- Requires versioning in source and destination.
- Replicates new objects only; existing objects require S3 Batch Replication.

## Storage Classes
| Class | Durability | Availability | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Standard | 99.999999999% | 99.99% | Frequently accessed data |
| Standard-IA | 99.999999999% | 99.9% | Infrequently accessed, fast retrieval |
| One Zone-IA | 99.999999999% in single AZ | 99.5% | Secondary backups, recreatable data |
| Glacier Instant Retrieval | 99.999999999% | Low | Archival, millisecond retrieval |
| Glacier Flexible Retrieval | 99.999999999% | Low | Archival, expedited/standard/bulk retrieval |
| Glacier Deep Archive | 99.999999999% | Very low | Long-term archival |
| Intelligent-Tiering | 99.999999999% | Varies | Auto-tier objects based on access |

---

## Performance
- Baseline: 3500 PUT/POST/DELETE or 5500 GET/HEAD requests per prefix per second.
- Unlimited prefixes per bucket.
- Optimizations:
  - Multi-part uploads (parallelize large files).
  - S3 Transfer Acceleration (edge locations).
  - Byte-range fetches (parallel GETs, partial downloads).

---

## Events & Metadata
- **Event Notifications:** Trigger Lambda, SQS, or SNS on object changes.
- **User Metadata:** Custom key-value pairs (`x-amz-meta-*`).
- **Tags:** Fine-grained access and analytics.
- **CORS:** Cross-origin web access.

---

## Advanced Features
- **Pre-Signed URLs:** Temporary access for GET/PUT operations.
- **Access Points:** Simplify security at scale, per-VPC or public.
- **S3 Object Lambda:** Transform objects on retrieval (redaction, format conversion, image resizing).

---

## Hybrid & Offline Options (Snow Family)
- Devices: Snowcone, Snowball Edge, Snowmobile.
- Use cases: data migration, edge computing, offline processing.
- Can run EC2 instances or Lambda functions locally.
- Managed via **AWS OpsHub**.

---

## Lifecycle Management
- Transition objects to cheaper storage classes automatically.
- Expiration rules for old or incomplete objects.
- Analytics inform optimal lifecycle policies.
