ADD

The add instruction is used to copy files and folders into the docker image being built. The add
instruction can do more than the copy instruction. copy is limited to files and folders where as add
can copy files; folders, tar files and urls. When the add copies a tar file the contents are extracted.
This does not copy the file permissions, you will need to run RUN chown -R X:X after you add tar file.
ADD [--chown=<user>:<group>] <src>... <dest>
ADD [--chown=<user:<group>] ["<src>",... "<dest>"]

ADD
https://github.com/docker-library/
hello /
RUN chmod +x /hello
CMD ["/hello"]

Adding urls is not recommended, instead do this:
RUN mkdir -p /usr/src/thins \
  && curl -SL https:/example.com/big.tar.xz \
  | tar -xJC /usr/src/things \
  && make -C /usr/src/things all
