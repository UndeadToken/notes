USER

The user instruction allows you to set the current user (and group) for all the instructions that follow
in the Dockerfile and for the containers that are run from the built image. if a named user or group
is provided as parameters to the USER instruction that user and the group must already exist in the passwd
file. The user instruction creates a zero-byte-sized layer in the image.

USER <user>[:<group>]
USE <UID>[:<GID>]
