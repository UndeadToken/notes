EXPOSE

The expose instruction is a way to document what network ports the image expects
to be opened when container is run. This does not actually open the network ports.
it is still necessary to include a -p or -P parameters to actually open the
network ports to the container.

The expose instruction creates a zero-byte-sized layer in the resulting image.

EXPOSE <port>
