FROM

This instruction sets the base for the image. Must be the first instruction (with the exception of ARG.)
If no tag is specified, the latest tag will be assumed. e.g. FROM nginx:1.15.2 The FROM instruction
will create the first layer in our new image. The size of this layer will be the size of the image,
nginx would be smaller than an OS, an OS like Alpine would be smaller than ones like Ubuntu. Size matters
folks. Alternatively there is a special keyword that can  be used as a parameter to the FROM instruction,
scratch. Scratch is not an image it is just a signal to the Docker daemon that you want to build an image
with an empty base-layer.

FROM alpine:latest

FROM scratch
