SwarmKit is the orchestration mechanism released to handle clusters of services
of any size.

"Toolkit for orchestrating distributed systems at any scale. It includes
primitives for node discovery, raft-based consensus, task scheduling, and more."

Swarm clusters are made of active nodes, that can either act as managers or workers.
Managers, that coordinate via Raft, are responsible for allocating resources,
orchestrating services, and dispatching tasks along the cluster. Workers run
tasks.

The cluster goal is to execute services, so what's required to be run is defined
at a high level. Work units assigned to nodes are instead called tasks. A task
allocated for a "web" service could be, for example, a container running The
nginx container, and may be named as web.5.

It's important to notice that we are speaking of services and that a service may
be containrs. May be, not necessary. The intention of SwarmKit is to theoretically
abstract orchestration of any object.

# Architecture
In a SwarmKit cluster, nodes can be either managers (of the cluster) or workers
(the work horses of the cluster, nodes that execute compute operations). There
should be an odd number, preferably 3 or 5, so that there will be no split brains.
And a majority of managers will drive the cluster. A quorum is always required by
the Raft consensus algorithm.

A SwarmKit cluster can host any arbitrary number of workers: 1, 10, 100, 2000.
On managers, services may be defined and load balanced. For example a service
may be "web". A "web" service will be physically made of several tasks, running
on the cluster nodes, including managers, for example one task can be a single
nginx Docker container.

In SwarmKit, an operator uses a swarmctl binary to interact with the system
remotely, invoking operations on the leader master. Masters, that run a binary
called swarmd, agree on a leader via Raft, keep the status of services and tasks,
and schedule jobs on workers.

Workers run the Docker Engine, and take jobs running them as separate containers.

# How a manager chooses the best node for a task.
The way that SwarmKit spawns tasks over the cluster is called scheduling. The
scheduler is an algorithm that uses criteria such as filters to decide where to
physically start a task.

# The heart of SwarmKit: swarmd
The core binary to start a SwarmKit service is called swarmd, and that's the daemon
to create both the master and join slaves.

It can bind itself to either a local UNIX socket and to a TCP socket, but in
both cases manageable by the swarmctl utility by connecting (another) dedicated
UNIX local socket.

# The controller of SwarmKit: swarmctl
docker run -ti fsoppelsa/swarmkit swarmctl --help

swarmctl is the client of SwarmKit. It's the tool used for operating SwarmKit
clusters.
