HAproxy listens for incoming requests then forwards them to various servers.
It is a software package that acts as both a reverse proxy and a load balancer
for TCP-connected applications.

A reverse proxy sits in front of your server and accepts requests from clients
on its behalf.

Check for errors:
haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg -c
