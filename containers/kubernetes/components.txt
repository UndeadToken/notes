A kubernetes cluster has several master components used to control the cluster,
as well as node components that run on each cluster node.

# Master components
The master components typically run on one node, but in highly available or
very large cluster, they may be spread across multiple nodes.

# API Server
The Kube API server exposes the Kubernetes REST API. It can easily scale
horizontally as it is stateless and stores all the data in the etcd cluster.
The API server is the embodiment of the Kubernetes control plane.

# Etcd
Etcd is a higly reliable distributed data store. Kubernetes uses it to store
the entire cluster state. In small, transient cluster a single instance of etcd
can run on the same node with all the other master components. But, for more
substantial clusters, its typical to have a 3-node or even 5-node etcd cluster
for redundancy and high availability.

# Controller manager
The controller manager is a collection of various managers rolled up into one
binary. It contains the replication controller, the pod controller, the services
controller, the endpoints controller and others. All these managers watch over
the state of the cluster via the API and their job is to steer the cluster into
the desired state.

# Scheduler
The kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling pods into nodes. Interacting
factors include:
- Resource requirements
- Service requirements
- Hardware/software policy constraints
- Affinity and anti-affinity specifications
- Data locality
- Deadlines

# DNS
Starting with Kubernetes 1.3, a DNS service is part of the standard Kubernetes
cluster. It is scheduled as a regular pod. Every service (except headless
services) receives a DNS name. Pods can receive a DNS name too. This is very
useful for automatic discovery.

# Node components
Nodes in a cluster need a couple of components to interact with the cluster master
components, receive workloads to execute, and update the cluster on their status.

# Proxy
The kube proxy does low-level network housekeeping on each node. It reflects
the kubernetes services locally and can do TCP and UDP forwarding. It finds
cluster IPs via environment variables or DNS.

# Kubelet
The kubelet is the kubernetes representative on the node. It oversees
communicating with the master components and manage the running of pods. That
includes the following:
- Download pod secrets from the API server
- Mount volumes
- Run the pod's containr (Docker or Rkt)
- Report the status of the node and each pod
- Run container liveness probes
