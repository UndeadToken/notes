# Kubernetes API
The main API of kubernetes. List; get, create and update objects.

# Autoscaling
The autoscaling API is very focused and lets you control the horizontal pod
autoscalar, which manages a group of pods based on CPU utilization and even
application specific metrics. You can list; query, create, update and destroy
autoscalar objects using the /apis/autoscaling/v1 endpoint.

# Batch API
The batch api lets you manage jobs. Jobs are pods that let you perform some
activity and terminate. The batch api uses the pod template to specify jobs
and then allows you to list; query, create and delete jobs through the
apis/batch/v1 endpoint.
