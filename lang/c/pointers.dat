type *ptr   a pointer of type named ptr
*ptr        the value of whatever ptr is pointing at
*(ptr + i)  the value of (whatever ptr is pointing at plus i)
&thing      The address of thing
type *ptr = &thing a pointer of type named ptr set to the address of thing
ptr++       increment where ptr points
