By commiting to a specific type for the elements of the sequence:
auto rates = GetRates();
for (int rate : rates)
	std::cout << rate << std::endl;
for (int& rate : rates)
	rate *= 2

By not specifying a type and letting the compiler decude it:
for (auto&& rate : GetRates())
	std::cout << rate << std::endl;
for (auto & rate : rates)
	rate *= 2

By using structured bindings and decomposition declaration in C++17:
for (auto&& [rate, flag] : GetRates())
	std::cout << rate << std::endl;
