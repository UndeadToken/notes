References - safe pointers:
These are like pointers in c, but they are checked for correctness. They can
never be null and always point to some data owned by any variable. The data they
point to can be on the stack, heap or the data segment of the binary.

&T - Immutable reference to a type T.
&mut T - Immutable pointer to a type T.

Raw pointers:
Prefixed with *, which also happens to be the dereference operator. They are
mostly used in unsafe code. One needs an unsafe block to dereference them.

*const T - An immutable raw pointer to a type T. Nullable.
*mut T - A mutable raw pointer to a value T, which is not copy.

A referenced can be Cast as a raw pointer.

let a = &56;
let a_raw_ptr = a as *const u32;

let b = &mut 5634.4;
let b_mut_ptr = b as *mut T;

Smart pointers:
These have extra metadata that gets executed when they are created or destroyed.
