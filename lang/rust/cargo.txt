Cargo:
Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager

cargo --version

cargo --update

cargo doc, cargo doc --open

cargo new hello_cargo --bin

We passed the --bin argument to cargo new because our goal is to
make an executable application, as opposed to a library. Executa-
bles are binary executable files often called just binaries. We’ve given
hello_cargo as the name for our project, and Cargo creates its files in
a directory of the same name that we can then go into.

--vcs (no version control system)

TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language)

cargo build
cargo run or ./target/debug/<file>

Building for Release
When your project is finally ready for release, you can use cargo build
--release to compile your project with optimizations. This will cre-
ate an executable in target/release instead of target/debug. These opti-
mizations make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on makes
your program take longer to compile. This is why there are two differ-
ent profiles: one for development when you want to be able to rebuild
quickly and often, and one for building the final program you’ll give to
a user that won’t be rebuilt and that we want to run as fast as possi-
ble. If you’re benchmarking the running time of your code, be sure to
run cargo build --release and benchmark with the executable in
target/release.
