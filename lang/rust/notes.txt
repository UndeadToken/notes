Dispatch
The process by which a an API has to figure out the method implementation to invoke
on an instance of a type that's passed to teh API. This process of methjod resolution
in a polymorphic context is caled dispatch, and invoking the method is called dispatching.

Monomorphization
The process of generating specialized functions with concrete types at compile time.
Also known as Static Dispatch, when the method to invoke is decided at compile time.

Polymorphism
The process by which an abstraction superseeds its parents implementation during runtime.
Dynamic Dispatch, when the method call isn't decided until runtime.
(Looks through interface implementations in vtable, which is a list of function pointers which point to each types implemented method.)
