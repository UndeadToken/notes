Compile time memory safety:
The Rust compiler can track variables owning a resource in your program at compile time and does all of this without a garbage collector.

Zero cost abstractions:

Fearless concurrency

Type Inference:
Rusts type inference is based on the Hindly Milner type system. It's a set of rules and algorithms that enable type inference in a programming language. It's an efficient type inferenbce method that performs in linear time, making it practical to type check large programs.


---------

Variable assignment:
let x = 5;
let y = {
  let x = 3;
  x + 1
};

let number = if condition {
  5
} else {
  6
};

Loops:

loop {
  println!("again!");
}

while number != 0 {
  println!("{}!", number);
  number = number - 1;
}

for element in a.iter() { 
  println!("the value is: {}", element);
}

Return values:
fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 { 
  x + 1
}

Reverse values:
for number in (1..4).rev() {
  println!("{}!", number);
}
