The RFLAGS register contains a series of status bits (or flags) that the processor uses to signify the results of an arithmetic, logical, or compare operation. It also contains a number of control bits that are primarily used by operating systems.

For application programs the most important FLAGS register are the following status flags:
- carry flag (CF)
- overflow flag (OF)
- parity flag (PF)
- sign flag (SF)
- zero flag (ZF)

The carry flag is set by the processor to signify an overflow condition when performing unsigned integer arithmetic. It is alos used by some register roate and shift instructions.

The overflow flag signals that the result of a signed integer operation is too small or too large.

The processor sets the parity flag to indicate whether the least-significant byte of an arithmetic, compare or logical
operation contains an even number of 1 bits (parity bits are used by some communication protocols to detect transmission errors).

The sign and zero flags are set by arithmetic and logical instructions to signify a negative, zero, or positive result.

The RFLAGS register contains control bit called the direction flag (DF). An application can set or reset the direciton flag, which defines the auto increment direction (0 = low to high addresses, 1 = high to low addresses) of the RSI and RDI registers durign execution of strign instructions.

The remaining bits in the RFLAGS register are used exclusively by the operating system to manage interrupts, restriction I/O operations, support program debugging, and handle virtual operations. They should never be modified by an application program.
