All x86-64 instructions use operands, which designate the specific values which the instruction will act upon. nearly all instructions require one or more source operands and a single destination operand.

Types of Operands:

Immediate
A constant value that is encoded as part of the instruction. These are typically used to specify constant values. Only source operands can specify an immediate value.

Register
Operands that are contained in general-purpose or SIMD register.

Memory
A memory operand specifies a location in memory, which can contain data types. An instruction can specify either a source or destination as a memory operand but not both.
