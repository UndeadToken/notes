# --args supplies arguments to the program instead of gdb
thread apply all bt = dump a backtrace for all threads
gdb --batch --ex bt q --args = if it bombs, get backtrace

run [args] = start your program with [args]
break [file:]function = set a break point at [file:]function
backtrace = Dump a backtrace of the curent calling stack, shorthand is bt
print expr = print the value of expr, shorthand is p
continue = continue running the program, shorthand is c
next = next line, but step over the function calls, shorthand is n
nexti
step = next line, but step into function calls, shorthand is s
quit = quit gdb
cd, pwd, make = same as shell commands
shell = quickly starts a shell
clear = clear a breakpoint
info break, info watch = show information about breakpoints and watchpoints
attach pid = attach to a running process so you can debug it
detach = detach from the process
list = list out the next 10 source lines, add a - to list the previous 10 lines
bt - backtrace stack
