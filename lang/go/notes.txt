package. It is "exported". The name of each package level entity is visible
not only throughout the source file  that contains its declaration but
throughout all the files of the package.

### Compile-time checks for ensuring a type implements a particular interface.
```
import "fmt"

var (
// Works but allocates a dummy Foo instance on the heap.
_ fmt.Stringer = &Foo{}

// Preferred way that does not allocate anything on the heap.
_ fmt.Stringer = (*Foo)(nil)
)

type Foo struct { }

func (*Foo) String() string { return "Foo" }
