# Software Development Models

Software Development Lifecycle:
The SDLC is a systematic process for building high-quality software that matches the expectations of the end user or customer while ensuring that the project's cost stays within a reasonable bound.

Spiral:

"The spiral development model is a risk-driven process model generator that takes a cyclic approach to progressively expand the project scope while at the same time decreasing the degree of risk."

The spiral development model was introduced by Barry Boehm in 1986 [5] as an approach to minimize risk when developing large-scale projects associated with significant development costs.

In the context of software engineering, risks are defined as any kind of situation or sequence of events that can cause a project to fail to meet its goals. Examples of various degrees of failure include the following:

- Missing the delivery deadline
- Exceeding the project budget
- Delivering software on time, depending on the hardware that isn't available yet

Under this definition, risk is the primary factor that helps project stakeholders answer the following questions:

- What steps should we follow next?
- How long should we keep following those steps before we need to reevaluate risk?

Agile:

Agile development advocates building software in an incremental fashion by iterating in multiple, albeit relatively, short cycles. Making use of self-organizing and cross-functional teams, it evolves project requirements and solutions by fostering intra-team collaboration.
