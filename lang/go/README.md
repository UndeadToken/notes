### Software Engineering

IEEE's Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology:

"Software engineering is defined as the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software."

Questions a software engineer should be able to answer:
- What are the business use cases that the software needs to support?
- What components comprise the system and how do they interact with each other?
- Which technologies will be used to implement the various system components?
- How will the software be tested to ensure that its behavior matches the customer's experience?
- How does the load affect the system's performance and what is the plan for scaling the system?

Tests:

SDETs collaborate with support teams to transform incoming support tickets into bug reports.

- Acceptance tests
    Scripted end-to-end tests to ensure business requirements are met
- Performance regression tests
    Monitors performance metrics and ensures code changes don't trigger a breach to a SLA.

Site reliability engineering:
A site reliability engineer is a software engineer with a strong technical background who also focuses on the operations side of deploying and running production-grade services. According to the original role definition, SREs spend approximately 50% of their time developing software and the other 50% dealing with ops-related aspects such as the following:

- Working on support tickets or responding to alerts 
- Being on-call
- Running manual tasks (for example, upgrading systems or running disaster recovery scenarios)

The basic mantra of SREs is to eliminate potential sources of human errors by automating repeated tasks.

Release Engineer:
A release engineer (RE) is effectively a software engineer who collaborates with all the engineering teams to define and document all the required steps and processes for building and releasing code to production. 

The architect is the one person who sees the big picture: what components comprise the system, how each component must be implemented, and how all the components fit and interact with each other. In smaller companies, the role of the architect is usually fulfilled by one of the senior engineers. In larger companies, the architect is a distinct role that's filled by someone with both a solid technical background and strong analytical and communication skills.
Apart from coming up with a high-level, component-based design for the system, the architect is also responsible for making decisions regarding the technologies that will be used during development and setting the standards that all the development teams must adhere to. Even though architects have a technical background, they rarely get to write any code. As a matter of fact, architects tend to spend a big chunk of their time in meetings with the various internal or external stakeholders, authoring design documents or providing technical direction to the software engineering teams.
