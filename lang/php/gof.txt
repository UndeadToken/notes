Creational:
Creational design patterns concern the creation of objects themselves. Basic
instantiation of classes without using a design pattern can result in needless
complexity, but also in significant design problems.

The main usage of creational design patterns is to separate the instantiation of
a class from the usage of that instance. Failure to use creational design
can mean your code is harder to understand and test.

Structural:
Structural design patterns are fairly easy to explain, they act as
interconnectors between entities. It services as a blueprint for how basic
classes can be combined to form  bigger entities, all structural design patterns
involve the interconnections between objects.

Behavioral:
Behavioral patterns work to explain how objects interact with each other, how
they can send messages between each of the objects and you can divide the steps
of various tasks up among classes.

Structural patterns describe the static architecture of a design; Behavioral
patterns are more fluid and describe a flowing process.

Architectural:
This not strictly a design pattern (but the gang of Four didn't cover
Architectural patterns in their book); but is incredibly relevant for PHP
developers due to the web-oriented nature of PHP. Architectural patterns address
various different constraints in computer systems through addressing performance
limitations, high availability, and also minimization of business risk.

Most developers will be familiar with the Model-View-Controller architecture
when it comes to web frameworks, more recently other architectures have started
to emerge; for example a microservices architecture works by a set of RESTful
API's that are independent and interconnected. Some people believe microservices
move problems from the software development layer to the systems architecture
layer. The opposite of microservices often referred to as a monolithic
architecture, is where all the code is together in one application.
