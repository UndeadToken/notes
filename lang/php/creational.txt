Creational design patterns are patterns that concern object creation mechanisms.

--- Software design Process:
definition:
  "The process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces and other
  characteristics of a system or component." and "the result of [that] process"

Software design can be split into two levels of hierarchy:
  - Architectural design, describing how software is split into composite components
  - Detailed design, describing the specifics of each component in sufficient detail as to describe its component

--- Simple Factory:
A simple way to provide objects. For example a FooFactory may provide Bar's of
type Fizz or Buzz depending on the requested type. This may include the simple
use of a switch statement from which an instance can be derived.

--- Factory Method:
The factory method allows you to group certain classes together and deal with
them by means of an individual factory for a group of classes.

--- Abstract Factory
An abstract factory consists of the following classes: an Abstract Factory;
Concrete Factory, Abstract Product, Concrete Product and our client.

--- Lazy Initialization / lazy loader:
Load instances only when required, then return the pre made instance on
subsequent calls.

--- Builder
The builder pattern solves the Telescoping constructor anti-pattern by providing
functions that set, mutate, apply logic.

--- Prototype
Duplicate objects while minimizing the performance impacts of having to
re-instantiate objects. __construct is not run after after an object is cloned.
