Structural design patterns provide different ways to create class structure.

--- Decorator
A decorator is simply what adds additional functionality to an individual class
without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

--- Class Adapter
The adapter pattern allows an existing class to be used with an interface it
doesn't match. It allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.

--- Object Adapter
As opposed to adapting behavior through inheritance Object Adapters extend
behavior through composition. By consuming an already existing instance to
adjust legacy classes or by instantiating a new instance of the adaptee within
the constructor.

--- Flyweight
This pattern helps minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible
with similar objects.

Extrinsic: State belongs to the external context of the object and is input into
the object when it's used.

Intrinsic: State that naturally belongs to the object and therefore should be
permanent, immutable (internal), or context-free.

--- Composite
This pattern allows us to ignore the differences between compositions of objects
and individual objects.

--- Bridge
Decouple an abstraction from an implementation. Bridge an interface and concrete
class.

--- Proxy
A proxy class is merely an interface to something else.

--- Facade
A facade provides an interface to an array of sub-systems. They act as a simple
interface to a complex system.
