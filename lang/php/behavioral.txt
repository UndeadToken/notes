behavioural design patterns are all about the communication between objects.

--- Observer
The observer design pattern essentially allows an object (the subject) to
maintain a list of observers that are automatically notified when the state of
the object changes. This pattern applies a one-to-many dependency between
objects; there is always one subject that updates many observers.

--- Iterator
The iterator design pattern is where an iterator is used to traverse a container.
Iterator and IteratorAggregate are very similar except the IteratorAggregate
creates an external iterator and must return an instance of type ArrayIterator.

--- Generator
A generator is essentially a forward-only iterator.

--- Template Method
The Template Method design pattern is used to create a group of subclasses that
have to execute a similar group of behaviors. This consists of a template method,
which is an abstract class. The Template method consists of a skeleton of an
algorithm; the subclasses can use to change the concrete behavior of the algorithm.

--- Chain of Responsibility
When one object can't solve a problem, a chain can be used to delegate the
processing of the task to another object, thus introducing a chain of
responsibility.

--- Strategy
The Strategy Design pattern exists to allow us to alter the behavior of an
object at runtime.

--- Specification
The Specification Design Pattern is used top codify business rules that state
something about an object. They tell us whether an object satisfies some business
criteria or not.

We can use them in the following ways:
  - To make assertions about an object
  - To fetch a selection of objects from a collection
  - To specify how an object can be created by `builder to order`

--- Scheduled Task
A scheduled task fundamentally consists of three things: the task itself, the
jobs that do the scheduling by defining when the task that is being run and
when it is permitted to run, and finally the job registry that executes the job.
