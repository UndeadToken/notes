# Arm64 asm

The ARM CPU family is generally classified as a Von Neumann architecture machine. Von Neumann computer systems contain three main building blocks: the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and input/output (I/0) devices. These three components are interconnected via the system bus (consisting of the address, data, and control buses). Figure 1-1 shows this relationship.
