Implicit variables are predefined variables.

This variable contains the account address that triggered this transition.
In case, the transition was called by a contract account instead of a user account, then _sender contains the contract address.

_sender : ByStr20

The incoming amount (ZILs) sent by the sender.
This amount must be explicitly accepted using the accept statement within the transition. The money transfer does not happen if the transition does not execute accept.

_amount : Uint128

The current contract balance.
The _balance field can only be updated by accepting money from incoming messages (using the instruction accept), or by explicitly transferring money to other account (using the instruction send).

_balance : Uint128

The address of the contract when the contract is deployed.

_this_address : ByStr20

The block number at which the contract is / was deployed.

_creation_block : BNum
