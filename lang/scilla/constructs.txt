Variables:
- must be of storable type (all primitive types)
- can be either of type immutable or mutable
- all variables are initialized when contract is deployed

(*This is a comment*)

             IMMUTABLE           MUTABLE
------------------------------------------------------------
Mutability   Cannot be modified  Modified with transition
Implicit     _this_address       _balance
Syntax       (v_name : v_type)   field v_name : _type = expr

Implicit variables come by default of the contract.

                 EXPRESSIONS      STATEMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------
Operation Type   Pure Operation   Operations with side effects
Semicolons       No               Yes
Examples         Defining vars    storing fields, procedures

Expressions don't end in semicolons where as statements do.

-- Expressions --

Constant: (usually done in library section)
let one = Int32 1 

Match Expression:
match x with
 | pattern_1 =>
   ...
 | pattern_2 =>
   ..
 | _ => (*Wildcard*)
 	expression
end

Mesage or event expression:
{ <entry_1> ; <entry_2> ... }

Defining functions:
fun

Apply function to paremeter:
f x

-- Statements --

Accept QA from message: (smallets amount donated in zil)
accept

match x with
 | pattern_1 =>
   statement_1
 | pattern_2 =>
   statement_2
 | _ => (*Wildcard*)
 	statement_n1
end

Contract field to local var:
x <- f

Update mutable contract field:
f := x

EXP evaluation to local bar:
v = e
