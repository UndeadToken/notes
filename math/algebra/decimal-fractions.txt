A positive-integer power is a quantity multiplied by itself a certain number of times.

If a non-zero quantity is divided by itself once, it is said to be "raised" to
"zeroth" power and the result is always 1.

A negative-integer power is a non-zero quantity divided by itself more than once.

Decimal notation is based on integer powers of 10. The number 10 is called the
exponential base. It can also be called simply the base or the radix.

Orders of magnitude:
Each multiple of 10 is called an order of magnitude.
