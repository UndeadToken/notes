The Commutative Law:
Swapping numbers positions...

a - b = a + (-b)

ab = ba
a/(-a) = (-a)/a

The Associative Law:
Group the addends together any way you want and you'll end up with the same
result. This fails when  you subtract, so add then subtract. Hardly ever works
for division.

(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)

(a + b) - c = a + [b + (-c)]

(ab)c = a(bc)

Distributive Laws:
Expand an expression into a sum or difference of numbers.

Multiplication over division - a(b + c) = ab + ac, (a + b)c = ac + bc
Multiplication over subtraction - a(b - c) = ab - ac, (a - b)c = ac - bc
Addition over Division - (a + b)/c = a/c + b/c
Left hand division over addition / subtraction fails.

a(b - c)
a[b + (-c)]
ab + a(-c)
ab + ac(-1)
ab + a(-1)b
ab + (-1)ac
ab + (-ac)
ab - ac
