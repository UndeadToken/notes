### Variance

How is data spread around Mean. Square root of variance is called standard deviation.

```
S² = Σ(Xi - x̅)² / n - 1


t = [4, 3, 6, 5, 2]

Mean = 20 / 5 = 4


S²(t) = ((4 - 4)² + (3 - 4)² + (6 - 4)² + (5 - 4)² + (2 - 4)²) / 4 = 10 / 4 = 2.5
```

### Coefficient of Variation

Used to compare multiple datasets. Standard Deviation / Mean.

```
S Miles √1.25/3 =.6455      Mean M = 3.75
S Kms = √3.23/3 = 1.038     Mean Km = 6.03
```

Coefficient Variation (Both) = .1721

### Covariance

Tells us if 2 values are moving in the same direction.

```
Mean MC = 1532 Mean E = 45.2

COV = Σ(xi - x̅) . (yi - ȳ) / n - 1

COV(MC, E) = 5803.2
```

- > 0 : Moving together
- < 0 : Moving Opposite
- = 0 : Independent

### Correlation Coefficient

Adjusts convariance to see relationships.

```
S MC = 396.25  S E = 22.18

r = COV(X, Y) / S(X) . S(Y)

r(SMC, SE) = 5803.2 / 396.25 * 22.18 = .6601
```

- 1 < r < 1   
- 1 = Perfect Correlation
- Closer to 1 = CLoser relation to values
- Negative r = Inverse
- 0 r Means they are Independent
