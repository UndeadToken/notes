# Sampling

### Sample Definitions

- We take a sample of the population because we want to do "inferential statistics". We want to infer from the sample to the population.

- Reasons not to measure the whole population. Impractical and unecessary.

#### Sampling Frame

- List of individuals from which a sample is actually selected. "List" may be a physical, concrete list. List students enrolled at a nursing college.

- May be a theoretical list not made up yet. List of patients who will present to the Emergency Department today.

#### Undercoverage

- Omitting population members from the sampling frame.

- List of nursing sudents may not include everyone for administrative reasons.

- People who present to th Emergency Department at night might be different than those in the day.

#### Errors in Statistics

##### Sampling Error (Fact-of-Life error)

- The population mean will probably be different from your sample mean.

- The population percentage will probably be different from your sample percentage.

- Caused by the fact that, regardless of what you do, your sample will not perfectly represent population.

##### Non-sampling error (Error you want to avoid)

- Using a bad list.

- Make sure that you pay careful attention that everyone in the population who is supposed to be represented in your sampling frame is in there!

- Caused by poor sample design, sloppy data collection, inaccurate measurement instruments, bias in data collection, other problems introduced by the researcher.

##### Concepts in Sampling

- It is important to do your best to avoid non-sampling error.

- This is achieved by making sure you do not have undercoverage when sa,pling from your sampling frame.

#### Simulation

A simulation is defined as a "numerical facsimile or representation of a real-world phenomenom". it is essentially working through a pretend situation to see how it would come out in the case it was real. 

### Simple Random Sampling

A siple random sample of n measurements from a population is a subset of the population selected in such a manner that every sample of size n from the population has an equal chance of being selected.

##### Methods

- Pick random samples from a selection e.g. a hat.

- Generate a list of random numbers as long as the list of the population. Randomly assign these numbers to the population in he list. Take the first 5 numbers (Whoever gets assigned 1 through 5).

### Stratified Sampling

Stratafied means taken from groups. First, the list is divided into groups, or strata. This is a way to make it so that there are certain proportions of groups in the final sample. Next, simple random sampling (SRS) takes place for each of the strata. Singular is stratem. Plural is Strata.

- Divide entire population into distinct subgroups called strata.

- The starta are based on a specific characteristic, such as age, income, education level, and so on.

- All members of a stratum share this specific characteristic.

- Draw an SRS from each stratum.

#### Limitations

- Oversampling one group means your summary statistic is unbalanced.

- it is not possible to do without a list beforehand (like with SRS).

- It's also hard because you have to split the list in groups ("strata") then SRS from the strata. 

### Systematic Sampling

Systematic sampling can be done with or without a list. Systematic sampling is best described through the steps one takes to do it. 

- Arrange all individuals of the population in a particular order.

- Pick a random individual as a start.

- The take every kth member of the population in the sample.

#### Characteristics of Systematic Sampling

- You cannot do this when there is a pattern to the data (boy/girl/boy/girl).

- You can do systematic sampling in a clinical setting, where you do not know who is going to come in that day.

### Cluster Sampling

The problem is in a geographic location. Cluster sampling is used when geography is important in sampling. The map is divided into areas and all the people in a particular area are sampled. biased toward type of people living in the area.

- Sometimes the people located in the cluster are all similar in a way that makes the problem hard to study.

- if cancer reates are high all over the clusters, it's hard to see if a geographic location is causing higher rates.

### Convenience & Mult-stage sampling

#### Convenience Sampling

Using results or data that are conveniently or readily obtained. Can be useful if not a lot of resources allocated to the study. Use an already-assembled group for surveys. Ask patients in the waiting room to fill out a survey, or students in a class.

- Convenience sampling can be used under low risk circumstances.

- What ice cream is the best from the restaurant next to the hospital? 

- However, often results are not reliable.

- There is a bias in every group.

- Often miss important subpopulations what stratified sampliing addresses.

- Results can be severely biased.

#### Multi-stage Sampling

Combination of sampling strategies layered in stages. Goverments typically use multi-stage sampling.

- Stage 1: Cluster sample of states (two census regions)

- Stage 2: Simple random sample of counties (from each state)

- Stage 3: Stratified sample of schools (urban/rural)

- State 4: Stratified sample of classrooms.
