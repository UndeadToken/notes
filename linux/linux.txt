The virtual file systems /proc/ and /sys/ contain data exported from the kernel regarding detected hardware.

Applications access devices by the way of files within /dev/.

for instance /dev/sda, partitions /dev/sda1, mice /dev/input/mouse0, keyboards /dev/input/event0, sounds cards /dev/snd0/*, serial ports /dev/ttyS*.

Device files are either blocks or characters. Characters start with c and blocks start with b where using ls -la ... Both types can be interfaced with via ioctl system call. 

Making a file system. mkfs.ext3

type can be used to determine location of utility.
e.g. type ls

/etc/profile or /etc/environment can be used for global interpreter settings.

The filesystem hierarchy(FHS) is consistent across linux systems.

read = 4
write = 2
execute = 1

rwx = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

_ _ _ = user, group, other = ugo
e.g. chmod 754 rwx for user, rx for group and r for other.
e.g. chmod -R a+x will recursively add user executable rights.

Memory:
free - memory usage
id - identity of user
uname -a - kernel version etc...


Write null bytes to device
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=1


-
fdisk /dev/sdb
type d to delete partitions
type n to create partition
type w to write
umount /dev/sdb
mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1 or sudo mkfs -t vfat -I /dev/sdb1
