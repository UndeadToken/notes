# for systems that don't use systemd, rsyslogd is the main utility for logging error and debugging messages, although some older systems still use syslogd. You can still use rsyslogd with systemd.

# systemd uses journalctl for gathering and collecting data.
journalctl --list-boots | head

-b # messages associated with a specific boot instance
-k # show only kernel messages
-a # show all fields
-f # follow messages as they come in

journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service # specific servics
journalctl PRIORITY=0 # limit by syslog level e.g. 0 being emergency
journalctl -a -f # follow messages as they come in, show all fields



# rsyslog
/etc/rsyslog.conf
boot.log
messages, security
