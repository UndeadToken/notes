A + on the STAT column indicates that the process is associted with the foreground operations.

VSZ(Virtual set size): shows the size of the image process in kb. It is the amount of memory allocated for the program.

RSS(Resident set size): Shows the size of the program in memory, the amount of memory that is actually used.Represents physical memory that cannot be swapped. 

List processes with user:
ps u

all users:
ps aux | less

-o select keywords
-e list every running process

ps -eo pid,user,uid,group,gid,vsz,rss,comm --sort=-rss | less

direct process output to file:
find /usr > /tmp/things &

Check commands running in background:
jobs

bring process to foreground:
fg %1

% - refers to the most recent command put into the background
%string - refers to a jobs where the command begins with the given string
%?string
%-- referes to the previous job stopped before the one most recently stopped

send to background:
bg %5

signals:
processes cannot block SIGKILL and SIGSTOP signals.

SIGHUP #1 hang-up detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process(reload config)
SIGINT #2 Interrupt from keyboard
SIGQUIT #3 Quit from keyboard
SIGABRT #6 Abort signal from abort(3)
SIGKILL #9 kill signal
SIGTERM #15 kill process
SIGcONT #19,18,25 continue if stopped
SIGSTOP #17,19,23 stop process

updatedb - generate locate database

killing processes:
kill 123
kill -15 123
kill -SIGKILL 123

kill all processes by name:
killall -9 something

nice values (-20 to 19):
default value; 0

the lower the value, the more access to the cpu the process has.

regular users can only assign nice value from 0-19 and can only set it higher not lower and only on processes they own.

nice +5 updatedb &

ask about cgroups.
