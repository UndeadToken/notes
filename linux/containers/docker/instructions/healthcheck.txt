HEALTHCHECK

Defines the command to run in the container to test the containers application health.
When the container has a HEALThCHECK it gets a special status variable which is initially
`starting`. Anytime a healthcheck is perfomed successfully the status is `healthy`.
If the healthcheck fails a value will be incremented until it exceeds the retries value then
the status will be set to `unhealthy`.
