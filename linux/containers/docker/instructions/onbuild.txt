ONBUILD

The onbuild instruction is a tool used when creating images that will become the
parameter to the FROM instructions in another Dockerfile. This instruction just
adds metadata, specifically a trigger that is stored in the image. This trigger
is used if the image is supplied as a parameter to another image.
