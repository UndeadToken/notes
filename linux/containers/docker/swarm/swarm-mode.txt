# DNS
The cluster managers assign to every service in the swarm a unique DNS name and
load balances running containers, using an internal DNS to Docker. For each
service created with a --name, every container in the swarm will be able to resolve
the service IP address just as they were resolving (dig myservice) internal
network names, using the Docker embedded DNS server. So, if you have a nginx-service
(made of nginx servers for example), you can just ping nginx-service to reach
the frontend head.

Operators have the possibility to publish ports to an external load balancer.
Ports are then exposed outside to a port in range from 30000 to 32767. Internally
swarm uses iptables and IPVS(IP Virtual Server) to execute packet filtering and forwarding, and
load balancing respectively.
