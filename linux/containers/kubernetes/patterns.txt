# Sidecar pattern
The sidecar pattern is about co-locating another container in a pod in addition
to the main application container. The application container is unaware of the
sidecar container and just goes about its business.

# Ambassador pattern
The ambassador pattern is about representing a remote service as if it were
local and possibly enforcing some policy.

# Adapter pattern
The adapter pattern is about standardizing output from the main application
container.
