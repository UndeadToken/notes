/bin  - common linux user commands such as ls; sort, date and chmod.

/boot - has the bootable linux kernel and bootloader configuration files(GRUB).

/dev - contains files representing access points to devices on your systems. These include terminal devices tty* floppy disks fd* hard disks hd* or sd* ram ram* and cdrom cd*. Users can access these devices directly through these files;    however applications often hide actual device names from end users.

/etc - contains administrative configuration files. 

/home - contains directories assigned to each regular user with a login account. besides root which uses /root for it's home directory.

/media - provides a standard location for automounting devices, particularly removable media. Typically the media volume name is used as a reference e.g. /media/thingy.

/lib - contains shared libraries needed by applications in /bin and /sbin to boot the system.

/mnt - a common mount point for many devices before it was supplanted by the standard /media directory. Some bootable linux systems still use this directory to mount hard drisk partitions and remote filesystems.

/misc - a directory sometimes used to automount filesystems upon request.

/opt - directory structure available to store add-on application software

/proc - contains information about system resources

/root - represents the root users directory.

/sbin - contains administrative commands and daemon processes

/tmp - contains temporary files used by applications

/usr - contains user documentation, games, graphical files, libraries and a variety of other commands  and files that are not needed during the boot process. The /usr directory is meant for files that don't change after installation (in theory /usr could be mounted read-only).
