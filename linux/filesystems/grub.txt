GRUB Boot Loader

A boot loader lets you choose when and how to boot the operating systems installed on your computers hard disks. The Grand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) is the most popular boot loader used for linux based systems. There are 2 major versions available for GRUB today. GRUB Legacy (version 1) and GRUB 2, the current version in RHEL, Ubuntu, fedora.

Syslinux is another boot loader you will encounter with linux systems. The SYSLINUX boot loaders are not typically used for installations. However is commonly used as the boot loader for Linux CD's and DVD's. SYSLINUX is particularly good for booting IS9660 CD images (isolinux). and usb sticks (syslinux) and for working on older hardware or for PXE booting (pxelinux) a system over the network.

To select and manage which partition is booted you need a boot loader.

Fo mo info:
man grub
grub info

default: the oeprating system will boot after five seconds.
timeout is specified in grub.conf or menu.lst

select an OS: press any key to see a list of titles to boot. The titles represent one or more kernels for the same Linux system or the may represent other operating systems.

press e on a highlighted titles to chnage the boot options.
or permanently withing: /boot/grub/grub.conf (changes applied during reboot)
or /boot/grub2/grub.cfg for grub2 generated by /etc/default/grub and /etc/grub.d

The record defines the the following denoted by numbers 1-7. 

root (hd0, 0)       
kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.32-131.17.1.e16.x86_64 ro
  root=/dev/mapper/vg_myhost-lv_root
 rd_NO_MD rd_NO_MD
  LANG=en_US.UTF-8 SYSFONT=latarcyrheb-sun16 KEYBOARDTYPE=pc
  KEYTABLE=us rhgb quiet crashkernel=auto
initrd /initramfs-2.6.32-131.17.1.e16.x86_64.img

1.) Shows that the entry for the GRUB boot loader is on the first partition of the first hard disk(hd0, 0)
2.) Defines the kernel boot image /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.32-131.17.1.e16.x86_64 with boot options. The options identify the partition as initially being loaded ro (read-only) and the location of the root filesystem root=/dev/mapper/vg_myhost-lv_root.
3.) Location of the initial RAM disk, whic hcontains additional modules and tools needed during the boot process.

Boot directly to a shell by adding init=/bin.sh to the boot line.

Boot with a given run level by appending the run level value to the end of the kernel line.
1 - single user mode
2 - multi user mode
3 - multi user + networking
5 - XGUI mode

Watch boot mesages
remove 'rhbg quiet'  boot option to show actiivty messages as the system boots.

Type b to boot the computer with the new options.

default=0 specifies the first option in the list is booted by default.
timeout=5 causes grub to pause for 5 seconds before the partition is booted.
rootnoverify (hd0, 1) caused grub to not to attempt to mount the partition
chainloader + 1 - pass the booting of the operating system to anoteh rboot loader. The +1 indicates that the first sector of the partition is used as the boot loader. Required for windows as GRUB doesnt have native support for windows.

Adding a new grub boot image:
e.g.
title Big Floppy Disk Nigga (Something Something dark side...)
  root (hd0, 4)
  kernel /something ro root=/dev/sda5
  initrd /initrd.img
