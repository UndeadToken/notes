Traditionally MBR (Master Boot Record) partition tables are used to store information about the sizes and layouts of the hard disk paritions. Limited to 2 TB in size.

GUID (Global Unique Identifiers) partition tables used as part of the UEFI computer architecture to replace the BIOS method of booting the system. Limited to 9.4ZB (Zettabytes).

x86 devices can have up to 4 partitions while SCSI and USB devices can have up to 16 e.g. sdc15.

Tools: 
MBR - fdisk
GUID - gdisk

-l    view
-c    turn off DOS compaitibility mode
-u    show size in sectros instead of cylinders     

Sync the disk partition table with the kernel.
partprobe /dev/sdc

Create a filesystem
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdc1
mkswap /dev/x
mkfs -t vfat /dev/x
pvcreate /dev/x        LVM physical volume

Create a mount point and mount the partition.
mkdir /mnt/test
mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/test
df -h /mnt/test

Unmount the drive
umount

-- fdisk options
t         specify partition type (in hex): Linux (83), swap space (82), FAT32 (x), Linux LVM (8e), Extended (c)

Check kernel for mounted partitions:
grep sdc /proc/partitions

Setting up mount options in /etc/fstab
/dev/sdc1    /mnt/test    ext4    defaults    0 1
defaults = mount on boot...
0 = not backup files...
1 = check for errors after certain number of mounts

An entry in the /etc/fstab file tells linux each partitions device name and where to mount it. Mounting is done when the system boots.

/boot - make sure information in /boot is accessible by creating a partion of about 500MB, some older pc's can only access the first 1,024 cyclinders of your hard disk.

/usr - This directory structure contains most of the applicatins and utilities available to Linux users. The original theory was that that if /usr was mounted as a read-only filesystem it would prevent attackes from removing important system files.

/var - /var/ftp and /var/www can be separated to prevent the whole system filling up or being targeted.

/home - Convenience, easily backup a users data, prevent issues etc...

/tmp - Ensuring applications can complete their processing even if the rest of the disk fills up.
