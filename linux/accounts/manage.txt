The database of Unix users & groups consists of textual files.

/etc/passwd - list of users
/etc/shadow - encrypted passwords for users
/etc/group - list of groups
/etc/gshadow - encrypted passwords for groups

These can be edited manually with tools like vipw and vigr.

When invoked the users directory is created with it's contents defined by /etc/skel template.

getent command checks the system databases,including users and groups, using the appropriate 
library functions which in turn call the name service switch(NSS) modules configured in the 
/etc/nsswitch.conf.
