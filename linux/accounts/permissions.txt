read = 4
write = 2
execute = 1

rwx = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7

_ _ _ = user, group, other = ugo
e.g. chmod 754 rwx for user, rx for group and r for other.
e.g. chmod -R a+x will recursively add user executable rights.

Each directory begins with a 'd'.
Regular files begin with '-'.

For applications that can be run(executed) by any user you may see the 's' bit in pace of the 'x' bit in a permissions listing e.g. -rwsr-xr-x for user or -rwxr-sr-x or both -rwsr-sr-x. However ownership of the running processes is assigned to the applications user/group instead of the the user launching the command.

By appending the 't' bit e.g. drwxr-xr-x-t a directories owner can allow other users and groups to add files to a directory but prevent users from deleting eachothers files. A capital S or T in place of the execute bit may also represent this but the execute, for some reason, is not turned on.

The '+' bit appended to permissions sets means that extended attributes such as Access Control lists (ACL's) or SELinux are set on the file..

d - directory
l - symbolic link
b - block device
c - character device
s - socket
p - named pipe

chmod a-w file -r-xr-xr-x
chmod o-x file -rwxrwxrw-
chmod go-rwx file -rwx------
chmod u+rw file -rw-------
chmod a+x file ---x--x--x

default masks:
regular user file: rw-rw-r--
directory: rwxrwxr-x
root user file: rw-r--r--
root directory: rwxr-xr-x

`umask` can be used to determine your umask value.

change ownership:

chown joe /my/dir
chown joe:joe /my/dir


Use files:
set user ID bit                     4                       u+s
Set group ID bit                    2                       g+s
Sticky bit                          1                       o+t
