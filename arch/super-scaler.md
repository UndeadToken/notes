# Superscaler

Superscaler cpus have two ALU units, this allows the execution of two instructions at once. A two-way super-scaler processor can fetch two instructions at once from memory on each clock cycle, and it can also decode and dispatch two instructions per clock cycle.

Superscaler computing allows a microprocessor to increase the number of instructions per clock that it completes beyond one instruction per clock.
