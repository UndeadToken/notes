Attacker tries to take over an active session from the client.

Spoofing: intent is to sniff traffic

Hijacking: intent is to take over the entire session

Steps:
sniff - sniff the traffic between the cl;ient and the server
monitor - monitor traffic and predict sequence numbers
desynchronize - desynchronize the client session by sending tcp reset, FIN flags
predict - predict what ghe session token is
inject - inject packets into target server toi pretend we're the client

ARP(Address resolution protocol): is a broadcast protocol, resolves IP to MAC

Tools:
Ettercap - packet sniffer
Ferret - session hijacking
burp suit - session hijacking

prevention:
unpredictable session ids
limiting incoming connnections
reduce remote access
regenerate session keys after authentication is complete


--
IPSec - encrypt communications, modes: transprt mode = ip hgeader is not encrypted and it can be used with NAT(network address translation), tunnel mode: entire original packet is encrypted and does not work with NAT

Authentication header:
protocol that garauntees the integrity and authentication of the IP packet sender

Encapsulating security payload esp
protocol that provides integrity authenticity abnd confidentialiity to the entire packet in tunnel mode.

IKE(Internet key exchange)
protocol that generates different keys forthe encryption process

Oakley
protocol that uses Diffie-Hellman to create a master and session keys.
