lowest term / lowest form:
The numerator and denominator are as small as possible.
95/155
95 = 5 x 19
155 = 5 x 31
19:31

Negative Denonimators
-3/5 = 3/(-5)
-1/(-1) = 1 = multiplative identify element

Common factor:
6/10 = (6/2)/(10/2) = 3/5

"Brute-force"
1) factor numerator and denominator into products of primes, if original number
   is negative attach -1, making sure all prime factors are positive
2) remove common prime factors (occurs in both numerator and denominator prime
   factors)
3) multiple all factors in numerator, then denominator
4) if denominator is negative, multiple numerator and denominator by -1

210/(-390)
210 = 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 = 7
-390 = -1 x 2 x 3 x 5 x 13 = -1 x 13 = -13
7/-13 = -7/13

-ab^3cde/(-ab^2ce^3f) = b^1d/e^2f = bd/e^2f or
-1 . a . b . b . b . c . d . e / -1 . a . b . b . c . e . e . e . f = b . d / e . e . f

A fraction times a fraction:
1) ensure they are both pure fractions(they both consist of an integer divided
   by a positive integer)
2) a,c can be integers(positive, negative, 0) and b,d can be positive integers
(a/b)(c/d) = ac/bd

The recipricol of a fraction:
The recipricol of an integer, also called the multiplicative inverse, is the
quantity by which you must multiply the original integer to get 1. The
recipricol of any integer is equal to 1 divided by that integer. 0 has no
recipricol, 1 is its own recipricol and so is -1.
(a/b)(b/a) = ab/ba
ab/ba = ab/ab = 1 #commutative law

A fraction divided by a fraction:
1) Find the recipricol of the second fraction (the divisor)
2) multiply the first fraction (the dividend) by the second fraction
(a/b)/(c/d) # compound fraction (a fraction made of other fractions, ratio of ratios)
= (a/b)/(d/c) = ad/bc

(a/b)/(c/d)/(e/f)
(a/b)/(d/c)/(e/f)
(ad/bc)/(e/f)
(ad/bc)/(f/e)
adf/bce

Adding and subtracting fractions:
1) ensure no negative denominators
2) find the common denominator (both fractions have the same denominator)
3) Add numerators and put them over the common denominator
a/b + c/d
(a/b)/(d/d) + (c/d)/(b/b)
(a/b)/d + (c/d)/b
ad/bd + cb/db
ad/bd + bc/bd
(ad + bc)/bd

formula: a/b + c/d = (ad + bc)/bd
